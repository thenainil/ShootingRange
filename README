PROJECT NAME: Shooting Range Game

DESCRIPTION: A Unity game in which players have to eliminate all the red lights in the shooting range as quickly as possible and beat their previous time.

INSTALLATION: The user MUST have Unity and the assets downloaded (GitHub did not allow uploading such a large volume of files).

USAGE: 
Once inside, it quite simple:
1. Run the game.
2. Walk into the range and the timer starts.
3. Shoot the red lights (left click). 
4. The lights will turn off when successfully shot.
5. Move on to the next light (the timer is still going!)
6. Move through the whole course and exit when done.
7. You will know your time.
8. Reset the game to play again and beat your previous score.
